## About

The goal of this project is to show how easily you can create static sites using the content (text, images, links, etc.) stored on [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com). This project is configured to fetch data from a specific administrative area using [the API DatoCMS provides](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api).

You can find further information about how to integrate DatoCMS with Gatsby in [our documentation](https://www.datocms.com/docs/static-generators/gatsbyjs).

This websites uses:

- [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) as website generator;
- [gatsby-source-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/gatsby-source-datocms) to integrate the website with DatoCMS.
